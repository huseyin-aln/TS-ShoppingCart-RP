### Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- TS
- REACT

## Features

- The data was used by transferring it to the global state with the react context.
- A custom hook has been created where the objects are kept in localstorage so that the objects thrown to the cart are not lost when the page is refreshed.

## Acknowledgements

- This project is built using TypeScript and React.
- You can add new item to the cart and remove item from the cart.
- When you add or remove item, total fee will change simulatenously.
- When you add or remove item, total amount of cart will change simulatenously as well.
- I used localStorage to keep cart list thus your cart won't change after refreshing.
